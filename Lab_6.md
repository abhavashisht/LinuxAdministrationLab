# Experiment: User Management in Linux  

## Question  
1. **Create the `operator1` user and confirm that it exists in the system. Set the password for `operator1`.**  
2. **Create additional `operator2` and `operator3` users. Set their passwords as well.**  
3. **Run the `usermod -c` command to update the comments of the `operator1` user account.**  
4. **Remove the `operator3` user from the system.**  

## Description  

In this experiment, we will:  
- **Create user accounts (`operator1`, `operator2`, `operator3`).**  
- **Set passwords for the users.**  
- **Modify user account details using `usermod`.**  
- **Delete a user (`operator3`).**
