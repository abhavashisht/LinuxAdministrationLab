# Experiment:  

## Question  
Use the `touch` command to create sets of empty practice files to use during this lab.  
- In each set, replace **X** with the numbers **1 through 6**.  
- Create six files with names of the form:  
  - `songX.mp3`  
  - `snapX.jpg`  
  - `filmX.avi`  
- Create three subdirectories for organizing your files, and name the subdirectories:  
  - `friends`  
  - `family`  
  - `work`  
- Use a **single command** to create all three subdirectories at the same time.
